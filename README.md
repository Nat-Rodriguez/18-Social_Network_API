# 18-Social_Network_API

For this homework I will build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

This includes:

- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users
  - When a user is deleted, their thoughts are also deleted
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts
- GET routes to return all users and all thoughts

## Technology Used

- Express.js
- Mongoose
- Date.js
- Javascript

## Mentions

- I couldn't have done it without the help of the wonderful people from AskBCS Learning Assistant
